1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>If, and only if,
both sides of the numerator...</i>

2
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>is divisible by the inverse
of the square root...</i>

3
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>of the two unassigned variables.</i>

4
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:53,012
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate...

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,139
is equal to or less than
the value of one.

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,475
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,020
Oh, that?
Don't worry about that.

8
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,521
- "M" is...
- Wait. Why?

9
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,879
I just put that up as a joke.
That's probably...

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,154
...the hardest geometry equation
in the world.

11
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,823
How much extra credit is it worth?

12
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:14,825
Well, considering I've never
seen anyone get it right,

13
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,951
including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T.,

14
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,621
I guess if anyone here
can solve that problem,

15
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:23,791
I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again...

16
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,628
for the rest of your lives.

17
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,719
Max? Care to try it?

18
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,306
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

19
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,469
You got it.

20
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:28,562
Fischer! Fischer!
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

21
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,661
Thank you.

22
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:47,454
You guys have it real easy.

23
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:51,625
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

24
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,170
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is,

25
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:57,967
you go to one of the best
schools in the country:

26
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,969
- Rushmore.
- Shh.

27
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,137
Now, for some of you,

28
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,388
it doesn't matter.

29
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,142
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

30
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:11,187
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

31
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:17,027
Take dead aim
on the rich boys.

32
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,654
Get them
in the crosshairs...

33
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:22,157
and take them down.

34
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:26,450
Just remember:
They can buy anything,

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:29,621
but they can't buy backbone.

36
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:32,122
Don't let them forget that.

37
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,418
Thank you.

38
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,136
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

39
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,678
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,429
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

41
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:51,310
The least these little pricks
can do is hear me out.

42
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:53,853
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

43
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,980
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

44
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,400
I just wanted to say that I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

45
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,278
Um... your speech
was excellent.

46
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:05,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:06,989
- Thank you.
- Hello.

48
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,662
Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my
chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

49
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,829
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

50
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:14,873
Well, thanks.

51
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,546
You know...

52
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:25,007
I really think you're
right about Rushmore.

53
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:27,217
Come on, Dirk.

54
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:32,474
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

55
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,644
Sharp little guy.

56
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,481
He's one of the worst
students we've got.

57
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:56,705
<i># Makin' time #</i>

<i># Actin' the fool ##</i>

73
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,727
We're putting you on what we call
"sudden death academic probation".

74
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,437
And what does that entail?

75
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,897
It entails that if you
fail another class,

76
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,315
you'll be asked
to leave Rushmore.

77
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,151
In other words,
I'll be expelled.

78
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,568
That's correct.

79
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:15,322
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

80
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:19,117
Too many extracurricular
activities, Max.

81
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:21,371
Not enough studying.

82
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:28,876
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job,

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,919
but, the fact is,
no matter how hard I try,

84
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,004
I still might
flunk another class.

85
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,927
If that means I have to stay on for a
postgraduate year, then so be it, but...

86
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,096
We don't offer
a postgraduate year.

87
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,223
Well... we don't offer it yet.

88
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,308
Just bring up the grades.

89
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:48,146
Do you remember how
I got into this school?

90
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:52,315
- Yes. You wrote a play.
- That's right.

91
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,530
Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate.

92
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,032
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

93
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:02,201
And you read it, and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

94
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,370
Mm-hmm.

95
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:07,414
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

96
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,125
But I still might
have to expel you.

97
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,086
Couldn't...

98
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,838
Couldn't we just
let me float by?

99
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:17,090
For old time's sake?

100
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:19,301
Can't do it, Max.

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,763
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no, not again.

102
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,433
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

103
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:29,021
try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

104
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,443
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

105
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,527
That's the rumor.

106
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,655
And they're canceling Latin.

107
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:42,366
What?

108
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,452
I tried to get Latin
canceled for five years.

109
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,621
"It's a dead language,"
I'd always say.

110
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,750
Well, I guess
they finally heard you.

111
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,222
Excuse me.

112
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,975
Could I please see a list
of all the people...

113
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,185
who've checked out this book
in the past year?

114
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,978
Why?

115
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,147
Look at that.

116
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,650
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both;

117
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,445
"and I believe they both
get paid in the end.

118
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,030
"But the fools first.

119
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:11,200
Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button. "

120
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,579
- Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
- Where are you going?

121
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,710
I'll tell you
in the squad car.

122
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:20,753
Oh, and, Willie,

123
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,130
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

124
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:25,591
He died in his sleep.

125
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,174
Excellent. That was excellent.

126
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,176
That was great.
That was great.

127
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:33,764
Um, Irving... could you get some
root beers for anybody who wants one?

128
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,559
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

129
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,603
All right, next scene.

130
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,856
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

131
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:44,650
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are...

132
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,255
- to have someone like
you looking out for Dirk.

133
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:47,777
Oh, don't be silly.

134
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,363
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart...

135
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:54,619
some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

136
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,911
This has my number on it
if you need to call me...

137
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:00,040
or need help with Dirk
or anything like that.

138
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,667
Well, thank you very much.
Hello, Dirk.

139
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,837
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, honey?

140
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,629
- Fine.
- Bye.

141
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,213
It was so nice
to see you again.

142
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:12,803
- Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?
- What math test?

143
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,473
- I thought you had a math test today.
- No.

144
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,224
Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

145
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,935
Yeah, I got an extension.

146
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,062
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

147
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:26,149
- We shook hands.
- Big deal.

148
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:28,316
And I gave her
my phone number.

149
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:30,778
Buchan said he'd have
already banged her by now.

150
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,155
What?

151
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,491
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

152
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,785
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

153
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,539
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

154
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,791
What are you, a lawyer?

155
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,836
Hey, Mr. Blume.
Hey, it's Max Fischer.

156
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,630
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Max, my mom just showed up.</i>

157
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:53,551
<i>Is it okay if I leave early? Over.</i>

158
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,427
Sure, Charlie.

159
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,266
What's the secret, Max?

160
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,017
- "The secret"?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,523
Well, you seem to have it
pretty figured out.

162
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,900
The secret.
I don't know. Uh...

163
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,402
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do,

164
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:17,072
and then do it
for the rest of your life.

165
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,574
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

166
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:22,494
Shotgun.

167
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:26,125
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys...
- Get in the back. I said, "Shotgun".

168
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,209
Get in the back, Donny.

169
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,170
Let's go.

170
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:37,049
Did you invite that kid
to your party?

171
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,552
- Max Fischer? - Come on, Dad.
There's gonna be girls there.

172
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:42,390
- I'd rather die.
- Pull your head out of your ass.

173
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,977
- Good night, Mr. Littlejeans.
- Good night, Max.

174
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,936
I'll see you tomorrow.

175
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,904
May I see the back, please?

176
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,909
Certainly.

177
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,038
How's that?

178
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:08,371
Thank you.

179
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:13,251
I need a signature on this
geometry test, by the way.

180
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,005
Let's see.

181
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,257
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

182
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,259
A 37.

183
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:26,140
Oh, I don't know
what to do anymore.

184
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,266
It could have been worse.

185
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,602
You almost got the "A".

186
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,521
"Almost got the 'A"'?
Dad, what are you writing?

187
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:45,116
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs...

188
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,368
and putting on plays.

189
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,452
That's possible.

190
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,456
I should probably be trying
harder to score chicks.

191
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,503
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

192
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,463
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

193
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,673
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

194
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,343
You're like one
of those clipper ship captains.

195
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,679
You're married to the sea.

196
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:08,722
Yes, that's true.

197
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:12,225
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

198
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,484
- Hello.
- Hi.

199
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:31,786
I like your hat.

200
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:34,663
Oh, thank you.

201
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,833
You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

202
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,005
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

203
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,172
Uh-huh.

204
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:47,966
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

205
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:51,764
Well, let's see now.
How old are you?

206
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,183
Fifteen.

207
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,476
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

208
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,145
You should quit.

209
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,772
You're right.

210
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,693
And I should mind my own business.

211
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,492
Where did you go
to school, by the way?

212
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,787
- Harvard.
- Really?

213
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,288
That's a coincidence.

214
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,041
My top schools where I want
to apply to are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

215
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,460
My safety's Harvard.

216
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,920
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,047
What do you want to study?

218
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,801
Well... I haven't
decided for sure,

219
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:35,640
but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

220
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,640
What was your major?

221
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:42,560
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

222
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:46,984
Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear they're
not going to teach Latin here anymore?

223
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,819
This was more like Central America.

224
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:52,822
Oh, Central America
and whatnot. Hmm.

225
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,659
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

226
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,827
They've got
to make room for Japanese.

227
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:03,000
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages were based on Latin.

228
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,085
Yeah, they are,
aren't they?

229
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,088
Nihilo sanctum estne?

230
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:11,840
What's that?
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?

231
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,842
What does that mean?

232
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,970
"Is nothing sacred?"

233
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:27,398
Sic transit gloria.
Glory fades.

234
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,025
I'm Max Fischer.

235
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,735
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:40,327
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

237
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,162
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

238
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,339
In summation,
I have only one question:

239
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,049
Is Latin dead?

240
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:04,017
Why don't you just piss off,
Fischer, you dotty skid mark?

241
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,476
Was that Latin?

242
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,195
Never in my wildest
imagination...

243
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,613
did I ever dream
I would have sons like these.

244
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:22,993
What's your dad do, Max?

245
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:28,538
He's a neurosurgeon...
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

246
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:31,582
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain,

247
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,504
but he seems to enjoy it.

248
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,632
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

249
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,969
- So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken? - Yeah.

250
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,141
Were you in the shit?

251
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:49,601
Yeah, I was in the shit.

252
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:52,397
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

253
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:55,317
- All right.
- What's on Sunday?

254
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,985
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

255
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,362
Do you want to come?

256
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,325
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

257
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,704
Yeah. Thanks for
the invitation, though.

258
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,084
Come work for me.

259
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:18,254
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I could use someone like you.

260
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,091
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

261
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,052
My father may only be
a doctor, but we manage.

262
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,765
- One-twelves!
- Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking to you.

263
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,769
You're on the team?

264
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:34,770
I'm an alternate.

265
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,816
How you doin'?
Good to see you again.

266
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,744
Whoa. Neat.

267
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:04,425
<i># Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be #</i>

268
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:12,557

269

274
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,135

<i>Miss Cross?</i>

279
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:15,324
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation, the other day...

280
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,079
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

281
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,915
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

282
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,415
Oh, you did?

283
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,254
I understand you made
a very convincing argument.

284
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:31,883
I just thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're gonna continue the Latin program.

285
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,928
I'm very impressed.

286
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,681
Well, thank you very much.

287
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:39,349
Hey, you need an assistant?

288
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,351
- Do we get to have an
assistant around here?

289
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,103
No, I doubt it.

290
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,605
I'm on scholarship, though...
academic scholarship...

291
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:48,274
so I get to do odd jobs and...

292
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,943
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

293
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,946
My husband went here.

294
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:59,870
I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

295
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,955
Well, he's dead now.

296
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,956
So I'm not, actually.

297
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,291
When did he die?

298
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,126
Last year.

299
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,631
My mother's dead.

300
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:14,759
I'm sorry to hear that.

301
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,552
She died when I was seven.

302
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,806
I guess we both have
dead people in our families.

303
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:27,811
What's going on in here?

304
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,194
These were just born.

305
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:37,447
I don't want alloys. I want steel.

306
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,825
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

307
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,954
Steel, Harry.

308
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:49,832
- So you've changed your mind,
and you want the job? - No.

309
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,169
But I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

310
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,838
What Rushmore
needs is an aquarium...

311
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,507
a first-class aquarium...
where the scientists can lecture...

312
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,842
and the students can observe
the marine life in its natural habitat.

313
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,470
- I don't know. What do you think, Ernie?
- An aquarium?

314
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,536
What kind of fish?

315
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,519
- Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout,

316
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,521
hammerheads, piranhas,
giant squid, octopi...

317
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,606
Piranhas? Really?

318
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,607
- Yes, I'm talking to
a guy in South America.

319
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,403
- What'd Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.

320
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,404
Why?

321
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,160
Because at this moment, I feel the
best strategy is to keep it low profile.

322
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:27,163
The more preparation work I can do,
the stronger our case will be...

323
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,206
- when we take it to the administration.
- How much money do you want?

324
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,502
Thirty-five thousand dollars,
for the initial plans.

325
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,389
I'll give you 2,500.

326
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,932
Okay.

- You're welcome.

340
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,311
- Max.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:21,854
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

342
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:26,693
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

343
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:35,410
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

344
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,870
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student...

345
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:40,915
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

346
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,937
- I'm surprised you
brought it up so bluntly.

347
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,877
I just want to make sure...

348
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:50,468
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

349
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,261
Good.

350
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:55,054
And, um...

351
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:58,683
the... the truth is, neither
one of us has the slightest idea...

352
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:00,600
where this relationship is going.

353
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:04,313
- We can't predict the future.
- We don't have a relationship, Max.

354
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:07,235
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

355
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,903
That's all I meant by "relationship".

356
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,780
You want me to grab a dictionary?

357
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:15,616
No, I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

358
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,701
I understand.

359
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,871
You're not attracted to me.

360
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:22,956
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

361
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,169
Max, you're 15 years old.

362
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:29,462
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

363
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:31,507
If you say so.

364
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:33,843
Look, all I'm getting at is that...

365
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:39,346
that I've never met anyone like you.

366
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:43,728
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

367
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:50,567
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

368
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,281
You haven't, have you?

369
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:01,286
Want to shake hands?

370
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:05,247
I'm glad we had this conversation.

371
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:06,750
So am I.

372
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,584
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

373
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,545
Oh, come on, Frank.
You'll have complete protection.

374
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,507
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

375
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,674
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

376
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:21,094
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

377
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,557
- Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court... - No!

378
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:27,894
- No, what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify.

379
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,436
Go, go, go.

380
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:33,357
I'll expect your gun
and your badge on my desk...

381
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,404
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

382
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:39,156
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end...

383
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:41,533
of the line... where I got to be.

384
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:43,325
So help me God.

385
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,452
<i>- Someone coming out of the building.
- I've got something!</i>

386
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:48,579

- There's action across the street.</i>

387
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:50,999

- It's Snowman.</i>

388
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,548
- He's getting on the "L" train!
- Take him!

389
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,050
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max...

390
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:03,345
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it,
Sanchez. The old man likes his cannolis".

391
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:06,056
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

392
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,724
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

393
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:11,394
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

394
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:13,438
Don't fuck with my play!

395
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,065
- You fucking cocksucker...
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

396
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:17,943
I'm gonna kill you.

397
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,492
Max. Max.

398
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,791
- I thought the acting
tonight was excellent.

399
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,147
Thanks.

400
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:57,856
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

401
00:26:58,023 --> 00:27:00,650
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

402
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:04,069
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

403
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:07,199
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

404
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:13,120
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

405
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:16,457
- There he is. Max, that was great.
- I'm so glad you could come.

406
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,542
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

407
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,003
- Hi.
- Who's this guy?

408
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,195
- Peter.

409
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,637
- I really liked your
play. It was really cool.

410
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:32,180
- Yeah.
- What happened to your nose?

411
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:35,684
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

412
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:39,104
- What's your excuse?
- Hey, author.

413
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,730
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

414
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:43,359
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

415
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:45,402
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

416
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:47,405
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross...

417
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:50,407
and I didn't catch
this young gentleman's name.

418
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:54,619
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

419
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,204
These are O.R. scrubs.

420
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:59,497
"O.R." they?

421
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,169
Well, they're totally
inappropriate for the occasion.

422
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:06,549
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

423
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:08,967
That's because you weren't invited.

424
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,344
Take it easy, Max.

425
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,554
- You were the one that
ordered him a whiskey and soda.

426
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,429
So what's wrong with that?

427
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:19,812
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

428
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:24,315
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

429
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,483
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

430
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,526
I wrote a hit play
and directed it.

431
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,946
So I'm not sweating it either.

432
00:28:31,113 --> 00:28:32,530
Can we get a check, please?

433
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:34,825
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

434
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,868
No, you're not. Excuse me.

435
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:38,997
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

436
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,166
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three,

437
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,669
but, uh, someone invited
himself along, so I apologize.

438
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:48,170
- Quite all right, sir. Very well.
- Okay.

439
00:28:48,336 --> 00:28:50,006
You're being rude, Max.

440
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:51,548
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

441
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:55,052
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play...

442
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:58,097
and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

443
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,141
- Would you like me to
pass you the creamer, Doc?

444
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:01,601
Yes, please.

445
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:05,689
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

446
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:09,647
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

447
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,775
How did I hurt your feelings?

448
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:16,241
Oh, my God!
I wrote a hit play!

449
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,829
And I'm in love with you.

450
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:33,508
Put that a little bit there.

451
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,612
- Hi.
- Were you hiding over there?

452
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:59,865
Uh, I didn't want
to disrupt class.

453
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,368
What's that you're painting?

454
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,662
That's a... a jellyfish.

455
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,625
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

456
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,836
Max wants to talk to you.

457
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,672
- What for?
- To apologize, I think.

458
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,173
Should we talk over here?

459
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:21,720
He sent you?

460
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:23,388
Yeah.

461
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,308
Are you his messenger?

462
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,645
No, I'm his friend.

463
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:34,357
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

464
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,694
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

465
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:42,405
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

466
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:45,201
No. No, I know, but...

467
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:48,202
I think I let him
get too attached.

468
00:30:49,122 --> 00:30:50,539
What do you think?

469
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,876
Well, I think
you did your best.

470
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,047
Tell him I'm sorry.

471
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,432
Okay.

472
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:12,185
What is your first name?

473
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:16,982
Rosemary. What's yours?

474
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:18,523
Herman.

475
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,823
He wrote you a letter.

476
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,700
<i>Dear Miss Cross,</i>

477
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:29,201
<i>I would like to take this opportunity
to formally apologize...</i>

478
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,827
<i>for the events
of the night of the 23rd.</i>

479
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:34,538
<i>I'm not accustomed
to drinking alcohol.</i>

480
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:38,835
<i>Please do me the service of coming to the
unveiling of a new venture I've undertaken.</i>

481
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:41,795
<i>I hope you will attend,
if possible.</i>

482
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:45,258
<i>I remain your friend, Max Fischer.</i>

483
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,725
Cut the music and no more pictures.

484
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:57,022
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

485
00:31:57,147 --> 00:32:00,149
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

486
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:01,733
Did you see her?

487
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,868
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

488
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:05,861
- Shall I go ahead and
take care of this tree?

489
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:07,170
Let's wait a few minutes.

490
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:09,531
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Oh, hey, Coach Beck. Good to see you.

491
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,243
This is where we're
putting in the new aquarium.

492
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,244
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

493
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:15,998
This is my baseball diamond.

494
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:20,084
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

495
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,878
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

496
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,900
Where did you hear that?

497
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,757
- My source indicated
that it was a possibility.

498
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:29,342
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

499
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,178
- Max?
- Excuse me, George.

500
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:34,181
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

501
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:36,516
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

502
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,309
I guess she got sick.

503
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,020
- You know she's not
sick. Give me the phone.

504
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,359
Janet, Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

505
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:49,777
Well, where is he?

506
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,324
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

507
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,994
I don't give a shit
about the barracudas,

508
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:57,538
but, fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

509
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:00,539
Max!

510
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,542
Where are those damn
chain saws coming from?

511
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,545
- He's right over there!
- Max!

512
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,713
- Max!
- Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

513
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:09,382
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- We're having a fund-raiser for the...

514
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,467
Turn that damn thing off!

515
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:14,012
Tell me this isn't happening.

516
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,140
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

517
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:43,371
...chapter seven.

518
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,921
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

519
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:51,422
His name's Max Fischer,
and he's actually asked...

520
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,799
to say a few words to the class.

521
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,719
Max, you want to take it away?

522
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:59,514
Sure. Thanks very much.

523
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,224
I just wanted to introduce myself.

524
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,733
I'm Max Fischer.

525
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:13,568
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy,

526
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,321
which I recently
got expelled from.

527
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:21,033
This is my first time
in a public school.

528
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,496
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,

529
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,707
but I'm no elitist.

530
00:34:26,874 --> 00:34:29,167
I think you've got
some great facilities,

531
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:32,753
and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

532
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,172
One footnote.

533
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,716
I notice you don't have
a fencing team.

534
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:41,054
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

535
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,186
- Max?
- Yes?

536
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,272
Hi, I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

537
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:54,567
- I just wanted to tell you that
I liked your speech. - Thank you.

538
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,697
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

539
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,865
No? How unfortunate.

540
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:04,202
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way,

541
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:06,120
- but I think I know...
- What do you mean?

542
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:07,705
- Well...
- You know what?

543
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:11,206
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

544
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:16,630
En garde!

545
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,431
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

546
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:34,315
Yeah?

547
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:36,483
Okay.

548
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,692
Hey, Max, how's it going?

549
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,444
Terrible. Tell me something. When you
talked to Miss Cross the other day...

550
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,905
Do you have a telephone pass?

551
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:47,074
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

552
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,181
I gotta tell ya, I don't know
what you see in her.

553
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:51,162
I don'tthink she's right for you.

554
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:52,831
What's that supposed to mean?

555
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,669
I mean, she's not
that beautiful.

556
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:01,088
She's not that intriguing.

557
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:05,009
I mean, she has something that
you can't put your finger on, but...

558
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:07,720
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments are
valuable, but let's get to the point.

559
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:10,681
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

560
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:13,475
- No.
- Hang on.

561
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,479
I'm talking on the telephone.

562
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,064
Oh, come on.

563
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:20,817
That's rude.

564
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,250
Hey, Fischer.

565
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,585
You better beat it, sonny.

566
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:44,673
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

567
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,011
Showboat. Always talkin'.

568
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:52,430
Picking a kid like Dirk because his mother's
a great piece, and then getting nowhere.

569
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:54,516
Like everything you do.

570
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,643
Big show. No results.

571
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:02,313
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

572
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:04,694
A fucking lie.

573
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:09,531
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium? Nah.

574
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:13,284
It was the hand job.
You want to know something else?

575
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,120
It was worth it.

576
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,331
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

577
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:23,754
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

578
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:28,049
I will. You okay?

579
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:31,969
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I miss Rushmore.

580
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:34,095
I miss the seasons.

581
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:37,099
Watching the leaves change.

582
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:40,308
By the way, what time
does the library close?

583
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:43,104
I've got an overdue book
to turn in.

584
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,153
That is your handwriting,
isn't it?

585
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,947
My husband gave me this book...

586
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,493
when he came to visit England
when I was 13 and he went to Rushmore.

587
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,163
So when he died,
I gave it to the library here.

588
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,461
You remind me of him, you know?

589
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:08,962
I do?

590
00:38:09,463 --> 00:38:11,130
How?

591
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:13,215
Well...

592
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:18,182
you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

593
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:20,934
Yeah. I was president of them.

594
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:22,935
He founded that club.

595
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,236
Do you think we can be
friends again, Miss Cross?

596
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:38,033
- In-In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course I do.

597
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:42,120
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

598
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,997
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

599

- I'll take the green one.

618
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:10,038
- And here's the knife.
- That's too fake.

619
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:12,290
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

620
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,460
What's your name again?

621
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:18,462
- Margaret Yang.
- Margaret Yang.

622
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,465
What are you doing seventh period,
Margaret Yang?

623
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,633
- I have guitar lessons.
- Classical guitar or... In what school?

624
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:26,971
- Rock. - Ro... That's good.
We can get you out of that.

625
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,473
Could I see you without
your glasses on, please?

626
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:33,727
Let's put Margaret down for 3:30
in the auditorium, Woody.

627
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,813
Thank you.

628
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,980
And-And bring
a head shot, please.

629
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:51,912
Hello, Herman.

630
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,497
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

631
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,916
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

632
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:03,299
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

633
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,843
Nice house.

634
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:12,014
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

635
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:17,061
Um... you were
in the neighborhood?

636
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:21,023
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

637
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,985
A trip to the museum
or something?

638
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,822
No, I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight.

639
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:30,574
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

640
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,368
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

641
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,079
Yeah, he's doing very well,
isn't he?

642
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,461
Do you want a carrot?

643
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,046
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

644
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,840
Thank you.

645
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:01,352
Well, I'll probably
be seeing you soon.

646
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,817
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

647
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,080
Sure.

648
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,415
The weather's nice, isn't it?

649
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,126
A little brisk.

650
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,462
I'll just get a sweater.
I'll be back in a minute.

651
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:02,580
Dirk?

652
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,749
I know about you
and the teacher.

653
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:20,262
- Does Max know?
- No, and I don't want him to know, ever.

654
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:23,390
I just want it
to stop right now.

655
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:25,727
You're a married man, Blume,

656
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,147
and you're supposed
to be his friend.

657
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:31,023
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

658
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,943
Oh, yeah. And with friends
like you, who needs friends?

659
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,459
Unlock it!

660
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:55,963
Little Calloway.

661
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,638
You're standing up
for the wrong guy.

662
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:05,641
Fischer ain't your mate.

663
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,602
What are you talking about, Buchan?

664
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:09,727
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

665
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:12,729
That's the only reason he picked you
as his chapel partner.

666
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:16,192
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

667
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:20,404
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

668
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,910
- Max would never say that.
- Yeah.

669
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:27,913
I suppose you're right.

670
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:32,540
After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't
need to impress anybody now, does he?

671
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:37,507
The killing's gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

672
00:44:37,673 --> 00:44:39,965
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

673
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,009
People be trying to kill you.
Are you talkin'...

674
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,928
...about you're gonna get rid of your gun?

675
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:47,680
It's time, homey.

676
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:49,432
Kiss me, Little Juan.

677
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:51,894
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

678
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,603
Is that for me?

679
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,275
<i>Dear Max, I am sorry to say
that I have secretly found out...</i>

680
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,277
<i>that Mr. Blume is having
an affair with Miss Cross.</i>

681
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:03,239
<i>My first suspicions came when I saw them
Frenching in front of her house,</i>

682
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:06,573
<i>and then I knew for sure when they went
skinny-dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool,</i>

683
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:10,953
<i>giving each other hand jobs while you
were taking a nap on the front porch.</i>

684
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,330
<i>Why am I telling you this now?</i>

685
00:45:13,497 --> 00:45:16,042
<i>Because you're such a good friend.</i>

686
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:17,709
<i>Take care, pal.</i>

687
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:20,964
<i>Fondly, Dirk Calloway.</i>

688
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,759
God.

689
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,719
How was she, Herman?

690
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,054
Jesus Christ.

691
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:33,726
Was she good?
I bet she was.

692
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,729
Although, I wouldn't know
because I never screwed her.

693
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:41,316
Going skinny-dipping
while I took a nap.

694
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,527
"Are you comfortable, Max?
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude,

695
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,030
getting hand jobs
from the woman you love. "

696
00:45:47,156 --> 00:45:49,739
We never went skinny-dipping.

697
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:52,327
Sure, you didn't.
And next you're gonna tell me...

698
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,414
you didn't just walk out of her house
at 2:00 in the morning.

699
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,916
I'm in love with her.

700
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:05,921
Well, I was in love
with her first.

701
00:46:07,924 --> 00:46:12,261
And all that crap about,
"I don't think she's that great.

702
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:14,055
I don't think she's right
for you, Max. "

703
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,559
That was all bullshit,
wasn't it?

704
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:20,728
Do you think
she's in love with you?

705
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:24,939
I don't know.

706
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:29,238
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

707
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:33,073
Max.

708
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,079
I saved Latin.

709
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,417
What did you ever do?

710
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:48,424
On the planet I come from...

711
00:46:48,508 --> 00:46:51,009
the sun only comes out once a year.

712

<i># From a tiny piece of colored glass #</i>

715

<i>This is Max Fischer. I have some
information regarding your husband.</i>

725
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,682
Thank you for meeting me.

726
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:41,975
You're welcome.

727
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:46,230
Would you like a sandwich?

728
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,814
All right.

729
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:56,488
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

730
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:58,491
Sorry it's not
something more exotic.

731
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,327
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

732
00:48:02,786 --> 00:48:04,747
Milk or apple juice?

733
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:06,915
Get to the point.

734
00:48:08,749 --> 00:48:10,709
Okay.

Your husband's...

- How long will you be
staying with us, Mr. Blume?

737
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,017
Indefinitely.

738
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,687
- I'm being sued for divorce.
- Very good, sir.

00:48:28,812 --> 00:48:30,812
Yo, shorty.

00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:33,024
Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

741
00:48:33,107 --> 00:48:35,735
I might want to take a dip
after I have dinner and hit the bar.

742
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,571
It's on the roof, sir.

Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

773
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,626
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

774
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:59,556
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

775
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:01,266
- This is private property!
You're trespassing!

776
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:02,892
What, are you crazy?

777
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:06,940
Wait a minute!

778
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:09,275
Stop!

779
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,156
- Let's have a truce for a second.
- Wait! Truce! Truce!

780
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,497
What's this all about?

781
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:29,543
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

782
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:31,919
- What?
- Did you say it?

783
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:34,840
Who told you
that goddamn lie?

784
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:37,010
Never mind.
I know who said it.

785
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:38,553
I think I'm gonna stick
a knife in his heart,

786
00:52:38,636 --> 00:52:40,803
then I'm gonna send him back to Ireland
in a body bag.

787
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:42,513
He's from Scotland.

788
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:46,854
Well, tell that stupid Mick he just
made my list of things to do today.

789
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:50,523
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

790
00:52:52,608 --> 00:52:55,861
So you received the package?

791
00:52:56,028 --> 00:52:57,613
Good.

792
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,033
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

793
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:06,706
I never took you
for an informer, Max.

794
00:53:07,456 --> 00:53:09,375
What's that supposed to mean?

795
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,710
"What's that supposed to mean?"

796
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:19,216
She resigned this morning before
I even got your little snapshots.

797
00:53:19,342 --> 00:53:21,425
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

798
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,347
But she's one of the best teachers
you've got. How could you let her go?

799
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:27,015
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

800
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:29,310
I'm trying to win her back!

801
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:48,036
Miss Cross?

802
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,038
Hi, Max.

803
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:57,712
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

804
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:02,009
Oh, here, let me see.

805
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,219
- No. Please. Look, I don't
think you should come in here.

806
00:54:05,262 --> 00:54:08,849
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

807
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:12,892
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but...

808
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:15,019
Please, Max...

809
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,106
- You honestly believe you
love Blume instead of me?

810
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:19,067
Yes.

811
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:21,317
Well, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

812
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:23,029
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross...

813
00:54:23,113 --> 00:54:26,206
- Listen, if you don't stop, I'm
gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't...

814
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:27,700
It's too late.

815
00:54:27,783 --> 00:54:29,700
It's too late.

816
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:35,917
Wait. Please.

817
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:43,297
I got kicked out
because of you.

818
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:46,801
- No, you got kicked out...
- Rushmore was my life.

819
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:50,180
- Now you are.
- No, I'm not.

820
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:55,478
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

821
00:54:56,019 --> 00:54:58,605
Do you think
we're gonna have sex?

822
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:04,275
That's a kind
of cheap way to put it.

823
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:06,819
Not if you've ever
fucked before, it isn't.

824
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:11,743
Oh, my God.

825
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:15,286
How would you describe it
to your friends?

826
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:17,581
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

827
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:21,209
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

828
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,171
Please get out of my classroom.

829
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:37,935
Fresh are you, sporty, me fuckup.

830
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,477
Hey, Magnus.

831
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,479
Got any good hand jobs lately?

832
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,614
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

833
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:53,491
It's your stepfather, waiting
for your mom so that he can get a piece.

834
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:58,829
Your mind's as warped
as your ear, Buchan.

835
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:06,213
Don't get nasty, brother.

836
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:29,193
We got him, Dirk.
We got him.

837
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:46,501
Max?

838
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:49,879
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

839
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,507
You said you wanted to meet?

840
00:56:57,177 --> 00:56:59,094
W- When?

841
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,055
Right now.

842
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:04,266
You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

843
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,272
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and
have that tree over there fall on you.

844
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,609
- That big one?
- Yup.

845
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,944
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

846
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:17,945
What stopped you?

847
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:21,660
I don't know.
What's the point?

848
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:23,828
She loves you.

849
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:40,762
She's my Rushmore, Max.

850
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:45,057
Yeah, I know.
She was mine too.

851

See you next time.

891
01:00:17,955 --> 01:00:21,418
It's been nice having
your company here at the shop, Max.

892
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,045
You put any more thought...

893
01:00:24,129 --> 01:00:27,298
- into giving school another shot?
- No.

894
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:33,552
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

895
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:36,805
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

896
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:40,893
You talked about being
a senator or a diplomat.

897
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:43,313
Pipe dreams, Dad.

898
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,606
I'm a barber's son.

899
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,610
See you at dinner.

900
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,384
Hello, Dirk.

901
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:17,722
- Hi, Max.
- What can I do for you?

902
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:21,349
- I thought I might get a haircut.
- We're closed.

903
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:26,228
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

904
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,689
But I guess I'll go now.

905
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,408
Merry Christmas.

906
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,451
What in the hell's that?

907
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,679
So, did you hear the news?

908
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:05,725
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

909
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,102
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

910
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:12,525
I'll send him a box of candy.

911
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,528
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

912
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:27,872
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in.

913
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:35,462
It's so good to see you.

914
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:41,383
Oh, these are glorious.
I'll put them in some water.

915
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,593
Have a seat.

916
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,975
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

917
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,935
No, he can hear you.

918
01:02:56,149 --> 01:03:00,736
Hey, old-timer.
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

919
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,366
You probably can't hear me because...

920
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,034
- I don't know if your
brain is damaged or...

921
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:08,619
What do you want?

922
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,958
Nelson?

923
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:23,049
That's the first thing
he's said in ten days.

924
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,970
Do you think he recognized me?

925
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:31,349
- Oh, I don't think so.
- It's Fischer.

926
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,534
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

927
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,705
Hey, amigo.

928
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,128
So, who gave you the shiner?

929
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,507
Either Ronny or Donny.

930
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,382
Can't tell the difference anymore.

931
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,345
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

932
01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:10,844
Hmm.

933
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:14,306
Kids don't like it when
their parents get divorced.

934
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:18,062
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

935
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:34,745
How is she?

936
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,873
I really wouldn't know.

937
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:40,416
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

938
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:42,460
What happened?

939
01:04:43,502 --> 01:04:45,629
She left?

940
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,967
She's in love
with a dead guy anyway.

941
01:04:50,592 --> 01:04:52,721
Edward Appleby.

942
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,599
You know, uh...

943
01:04:58,143 --> 01:05:00,560
she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

944
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:08,066
- Adios, muchacho.
- Hey, are you okay?

945
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:12,697
Mmm, I'm a little bit
lonely these days.

946
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:47,524
Max?

947
01:05:48,232 --> 01:05:49,943
What are you doing here?

948
01:05:51,526 --> 01:05:54,071
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

949
01:05:54,154 --> 01:05:56,697
- It was... It was so sudden.
- What?

950
01:05:57,073 --> 01:05:59,033
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?

951
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:03,079
- I just got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

952
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:04,915
Hmm? What did you say?

953
01:06:04,956 --> 01:06:07,084
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

954
01:06:09,796 --> 01:06:12,963
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

955
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:21,345
So, this is where it all happens.

956
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,518
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

957
01:06:24,643 --> 01:06:27,229
So, why did you dump Blume?

958
01:06:27,938 --> 01:06:32,565
- That's none of your business.
- I know it's not.

959
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:35,568
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

960
01:06:35,652 --> 01:06:37,213
I mean, I thought
you dumped me for Blume.

961
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:38,136
Then I hear...

962
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:40,616
- I never dumped you because
we were never going out.

963
01:06:40,783 --> 01:06:43,702
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

964
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:45,663
Tell me what happened.

965
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,376
Okay.

966
01:06:53,336 --> 01:06:57,047
Um, A: He's married.

967
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:00,927
He hates himself.

968
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:05,055
And C: Well,
he smashed up your bicycle,

969
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:09,102
- didn't he?
- My previous bicycle, yes.

970
01:07:09,185 --> 01:07:11,868
- Well, what sort of person
does something like that?

971
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,353
I don't know.

972
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:19,530
War does funny things to men.

973
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:23,781
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

974
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:27,995
What does that mean?

975
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:34,877
Well, I mean, you live in his room,
with all his stuff. It's kind of...

976
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:39,299
I was married to him.

977
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:43,009
- I know you were.
- Although, I will say...

978
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:48,013
that Edward has more
spark and character...

979
01:07:48,138 --> 01:07:50,058
and imagination
in one fingernail...

980
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:53,062
than Herman Blume
has in his entire body.

981
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,441
One dead fingernail.

982
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:03,780
Right.

983
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,822
One dead fingernail.

984
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:12,622
How did he die, by the way?

985
01:08:13,749 --> 01:08:15,333
He drowned.

986
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:19,295
How did your mother die?

987
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,670
She got cancer.

988
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,764
Hold still for a moment, okay?

989
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,980
You're very pretty.

990
01:08:39,438 --> 01:08:41,357
Thank you.

991
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:05,216
Is this fake blood?

992
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:10,386
Yes, it is.

993
01:09:11,428 --> 01:09:14,180
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

994
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,433
You're both little children.

995
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:21,729
Let me show you the door.

996
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,900
I'll just go back out the window.

997
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:42,791
- Good-bye, Miss Cross.
- Good-bye, Max.

998
01:10:00,934 --> 01:10:02,353
Hey.

999
01:10:02,896 --> 01:10:06,814
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about what I said...

1000
01:10:06,856 --> 01:10:09,233
about your mom
giving me a hand job.

1001
01:10:10,193 --> 01:10:12,360
I know, Max.

1002
01:10:12,444 --> 01:10:16,074
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

1003
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:19,162
Hey, uh, that's okay.

1004
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,168
What's that?

1005
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:31,754
I don't know.

1006
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:47,896
Nice landing.

1007
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:55,488
What's, uh... What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

1008
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,533
Hmm, pretty good.

1009
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:00,076
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

1010
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,078
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

1011
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:15,298
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

1012
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:17,304
- They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's...

1013
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:18,427
No, not anymore.

1014
01:11:19,136 --> 01:11:21,886
- Why not?
- Because it was a fake.

1015
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,180
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

1016
01:11:25,264 --> 01:11:27,933
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

1017
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:30,147
I thought it would,
but it didn't.

1018
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:39,988
You're a real jerk to me,
you know that?

1019
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,741
I'm sorry, Margaret.

1020
01:11:45,283 --> 01:11:48,244
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

1021
01:12:09,309 --> 01:12:11,852
Do you want to take over for a while?

1022
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:38,835
Take dictation, please.

1023

Come here.

I want you to meet someone.

01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:38,327
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

1051
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:43,790
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Fischer.

1052
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:47,336
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

1053
01:14:47,461 --> 01:14:51,091
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

1054
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:54,468
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have a look.

1055
01:14:58,889 --> 01:15:00,598
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:05,811
I don't know, Bert.

1057
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:10,025
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

1058
01:15:10,192 --> 01:15:12,694
Maybe we'll throw in
a shave as well.

1059
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:16,739
Okay, are you fond
of that mustache?

Do you think you want to keep it
for a while? Mm-hmm.

1061
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,870
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

1062
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:27,167
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1063
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:29,044
- Good, good.
- Why?

1064
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:31,211
'Cause we're gonna
need all of it.

But don't worry. Come on, Herman.

1075
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:51,871

you're prepared to spend?

our little groundbreaking the other day.

01:17:23,654 --> 01:17:28,034
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

1083
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:31,494
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

1084
01:17:31,577 --> 01:17:33,748
Me neither.

1085
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:37,959
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

1086
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:41,211
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

1087
01:17:41,336 --> 01:17:43,212
That's what I thought.

1088
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:47,050
Blume's got a bit more spark and
vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

1089
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:50,429
I thought the aquarium
was your idea.

1090
01:17:51,304 --> 01:17:53,390
Well, I gave it to my friend.

1091
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:56,102
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

1092
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:59,938
And... could you make
the order out to...

1093
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:02,314
Ready Demolition,
Tucson, Arizona?

1094
01:18:04,024 --> 01:18:06,110
Thank you very much.

1095
01:18:10,616 --> 01:18:12,535
Make sure these don't get wet.

1096
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:17,330
I'll see you at 3:15.

1097
01:18:17,372 --> 01:18:19,331
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

1098
01:18:19,373 --> 01:18:22,333
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

1099
01:18:38,641 --> 01:18:42,103
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

1100
01:18:42,187 --> 01:18:43,437
I'd have shot you
in the other ear,

1101
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,484
but it got blown off
a long time ago.

1102
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:51,446
- Besides, now we're even.
- Not for long, Kemo Sabe.

1103
01:18:51,613 --> 01:18:54,908
We'll see. I got
a proposition for you.

1104
01:18:55,034 --> 01:18:58,787
Well, you can stick it up
your mother's ass, you little prick.

1105
01:18:58,953 --> 01:19:00,872
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

1106
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:03,210
You've got a way with words.

1107
01:19:03,377 --> 01:19:05,169
You want to be in a play?

1108
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,715
What's all that shite?

1109
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:13,717
Nothing.

1110
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:16,470
I just think
you're right for the part.

1111
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:36,865
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

1112
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:40,537
I know you did, mate.

1113
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:55,298
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

1114
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:58,179
Oh, boy, I gotta call the hospital.

1115
01:19:58,887 --> 01:20:01,390
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Whitney, the English teacher?

1116
01:20:01,432 --> 01:20:04,307
- Yes. - Hi, I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

1117
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:06,310
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

1118
01:20:06,394 --> 01:20:08,438
- Hello.
- That's kid's gonna burn this place down.

1119
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:10,377
You better believe it.

1120
01:20:10,378 --> 01:20:12,233
- Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

1121
01:20:12,358 --> 01:20:14,609
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

1122
01:20:14,735 --> 01:20:16,780
<i>- Too late now.
- Officers Brooks and Donovan...</i>

1123
01:20:16,864 --> 01:20:19,283
<i>requesting additional units
at Grover Cleveland High School.</i>

1124
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:21,117
<i>- Units responding identify.
- A program.</i>

1125
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,037
Let me look at that.
Turn it, turn it.

1126
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,038
That's enough.

1127
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,042
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

1128
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,923
Hi, Herman.

1129
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,222
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

1130
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,191
Thank you very much.

1131
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:58,861
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me,

1132
01:20:58,944 --> 01:21:01,198
and I wanted
to make a dedication.

1133
01:21:01,281 --> 01:21:04,949
So, I'll just say that this play
is dedicated to the memory of my mother,

1134
01:21:04,991 --> 01:21:07,370
Eloise Fischer,

1135
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:11,250
and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

1136
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,961
Also, you'll find a pair
of safety glasses and some earplugs...

1137
01:21:15,002 --> 01:21:16,963
underneath your seats.

1138
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:20,632
Please feel free to use them.
Thank you very much.

1139
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:29,392
<i>Bravo Company, this is Tango 7.
Do you copy?</i>

1140
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:33,145
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action...

1141
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,773
This is a different kind of war.

1142
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:39,193
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

1143
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,913
How long you been
in country, soldier?

1144
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:55,249
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

1145
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,334
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1146
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,004
Right on, brother.

1147
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:04,297
Hoo. Hoo-hoo.

1148
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:09,930
Let's rock, Esposito!
I repeat, let's rock!

1149
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:13,683
Let's rock and roll!

1150
01:22:47,674 --> 01:22:49,427
Fischer!

1151
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:54,223
I'm okay. Go, go, go, go.

1152
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:56,725
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

1153
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:58,895
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

1154
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:00,209
- All right, bring me some more
ketchup very quickly, please.

1155
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,480
Effects!

1156
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:04,941
- This is gonna look stupid.
- No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

1157
01:23:22,167 --> 01:23:25,379
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1158
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:27,881
Hold this one too, okay?

1159
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:35,556
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

1160
01:23:36,932 --> 01:23:38,851
It's good.

1161
01:23:41,436 --> 01:23:44,438
But let's hope
it's got a happy ending.

1162
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:06,666
- Adios, Esposito.
- Adios, Sarge.

1163
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:10,671
Say a prayer for Surf Boy,
wherever he is.

1164
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:14,716
Semper fi, soldier.
Semper fi.

1165
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,261
Sic transit gloria.

1166
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:20,222
Maybe we'll meet again someday...

1167
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,349
when the fighting stops.

1168
01:24:25,184 --> 01:24:28,186
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries!
We're movin' out!

1169
01:24:30,276 --> 01:24:32,027
I don't know but I've been told

1170
01:24:32,193 --> 01:24:34,486
I don't know but I've been told

1171
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,621
Hello, Esposito.

1172
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,379
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?

1173
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,715
You bet I will.

1174
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:13,316
That's my son.
That's my Maxie.

1175
01:25:21,906 --> 01:25:24,787
I just didn't expect to see you here.

1176
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:26,830
Did Max send you an invitation?

1177
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,291
Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

1178
01:25:32,084 --> 01:25:36,337
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Yang.

1179
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:39,716
I, uh, actually wrote a different
version of the play two years ago,

1180
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:41,633
but I couldn't
get it done over at Rushmore.

1181
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:43,930
- Oh, really? Why?
- Too political?

1182
01:25:43,971 --> 01:25:46,932
No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

1183
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:49,935
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

1184
01:25:50,018 --> 01:25:52,477
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

1185
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,647
He's a barber.
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

1186
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:58,900
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

1187
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:00,487
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

1188
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:04,865
I'd also like everyone to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Yang. This is Margaret.

1189
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,702
- Hello, Margaret.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

1190
01:26:07,785 --> 01:26:09,995
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

1191
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:11,995
It's clearly a safety hazard.

1192
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:13,788
- Well, last year, he
tried to raise piranhas.

1193
01:26:13,789 --> 01:26:15,499
Yeah, I know he did.

1194
01:26:15,582 --> 01:26:18,755
- What did you think, Mr. Littlejeans?
- Best play ever, man.

1195
01:26:21,299 --> 01:26:23,258
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

1196
01:26:23,299 --> 01:26:26,302
Yeah? Fischer stepped
over half my bloody lines.

1197
01:26:26,386 --> 01:26:28,345
That's funny.
I didn't notice.

1198
01:26:28,429 --> 01:26:30,973
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

1199
01:26:31,056 --> 01:26:33,642
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

1200
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:38,399
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
- No, I'm a barber.

1201
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:41,276
But a lot of people make that mistake.

1202
01:26:46,321 --> 01:26:48,615
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

1203
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:51,868
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

1204
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:55,622
I loved it when you grabbed onto the
bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.

1205
01:26:55,706 --> 01:26:57,665
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

1206
01:26:57,707 --> 01:26:59,669
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1207
01:26:59,711 --> 01:27:02,212
Can you do
an Australian accent?

1208
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:04,798
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

1209
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:07,842
I really feel like celebrating,
you know?

1210
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:11,761
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes, I would love to.

1211
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:13,433
- Great.
- Come on.

1212
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:15,560
You're looking good, Bert.

1213
01:27:15,643 --> 01:27:17,603
Hello, Mr. Blume.

1214
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,647
Hello, Margaret.
May I cut in?

1215
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:23,691
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

1216
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:27,279
- Ah, new girlfriend.
- Yes, I am.

1217
01:27:27,362 --> 01:27:31,283
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

1218
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:35,204
No, it's okay.
He's my friend.

1219
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:44,085
Well... you pulled it off.

1220
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:47,505
Yeah, it went okay.
At least nobody got hurt.

1221
01:27:49,759 --> 01:27:51,219
Except you.

1222
01:27:53,179 --> 01:27:56,182
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

1223
01:27:56,391 --> 01:27:59,435
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

1224
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:04,480
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, but...

1225
01:28:04,563 --> 01:28:08,318
Here, let's see if the deejay can play
something with a little more... Reuben!

1226
01:28:53,486 --> 01:28:56,447
<i># Poor old Granddad #</i>

1227
01:28:56,572 --> 01:28:59,700
<i># I laughed at all his words #</i>

1228
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:02,912
<i># I thought he was a bitter man #</i>

1229
01:29:02,954 --> 01:29:06,041
<i># He spoke of women's ways #</i>

1230
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:09,168
<i># They'll trapped you
Then they use you #</i>

1231
